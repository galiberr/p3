# Beatles
Me, I'm just the lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is luck.
But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold.
Lay down all thought, surrender to the void.
And the time will come when you see we're all one and life goes on within you and without you.
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all.
Cream tangerine and montelimar.

# David Bowie
The return of the thin white duke.
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high.

# Cream
I'm so glad.
Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell.
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back.

# Jethro Tull
Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief, if he had a rich man in his hands?

# Elton John
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been.
What do you think you'll do then? I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
Maybe you'll get a replacement, there's plenty like me to be found - mongrels who ain't got a penny, sniffing for titbits like you on the ground.
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around.

# Paul McCartney
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs. What's wrong with that?

# Moody Blues

# The Police
The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street.

# Steely Dan
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide, call me Deacon Blues.
Nothing but blues and Elvis and somebody else's favorite songs.

# Talking Heads


# The Who
Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
